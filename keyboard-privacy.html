<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-family: 'PT Sans';">We do not collect data behind the scenes to run advertising programs, nor do we sell such data to third parties. <br> 
<br> 
We only collect data when you explicitly allow it, in an anonymous format. We NEVER collect anything you type in password fields. Due to Apple's design of the third party keyboard platform, if you do not give "full access" permission in the settings, we will not collect any data whatsoever. Furthermore, when we do collect data, we ONLY do so when it will help enhance the functionality of our keyboard, allowing us to provide you with the best possible typing experience. If it doesn't help improve the experience, we will not collect it.<br> 
What about the Apple third-party keyboard warning message when allowing full access?<br> 
<br> 
When you allow full access in the settings under "add new keyboard" tab, you will encounter a warning message stating "full access allows the developer to transmit anything you type, including things you have previously typed with this keyboard. This could include sensitive information such as your credit card number or street address."  This alert appears whenever any third-party input method is allowed full access. Fleksy is designed NOT to receive or log such sensitive data.  
<br> <br> 
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-family: 'PT Sans';"><b>Here's how:</b> </p>
<br> 
Our keyboards can collect three types of data:<br> 
Crash Data, including crash logs, in an anonymous format.<br> 
Settings Data such as setting preferences, gesture usage, and number of words typed with our keyboards.
Language Modeling Data such as common phrases or words that you use when typing with our keyboards.
We never collect any type of data without your explicit permission.
Language Modeling Data collection is disabled by default for all our products, and is not enabled during the installation process.
We do not log data entered into password or credit card fields.
When a user voluntarily opts in to supply Language Modeling Data to us, we always encrypt it both for transmission and storage, and host it in third party hosting facilities with industry leading security infrastructure.
We do NOT link any Language Modeling Data with your name, phone number, email address, or any other personal identifier.
Language Modeling Data is only used in anonymous format to help improve our keyboards' product and services. It is NOT sold, licensed or otherwise provided to third parties.<br> <br> 
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-family: 'PT Sans';"><b>Withdrawing Consent</b> </p>
<br> 
At any time you may withdraw consent of data collection by simply accessing the settings and disabling full access.<br> 
<br>
